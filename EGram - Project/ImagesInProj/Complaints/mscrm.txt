b. Persist to a custom table (recommended by Microsoft)
4. Go to CRM UI, do the step that causes the Plugin to fire. Then stop the profiler.
5. Go to VS, keep the breakpoint.
6. In the VS, Go to Debug option, select Attach to Process. Select process for Plugin registration tool.
7. Go to Plugin Registration tool, click on the Plugin step and click Debug button.
8. Supply the file if you downloaed file from Step 3(a) or select record if you have chosen 3(b).
9. Supply dll file and click on "Start Execute" button.

Update Plugin:
-----------------
Important points:

=> Platform does not pass all the attributes in the entity object.
=> Only change values are passed as attributes.
=> You can use service.Retrive to pull unchanged attributes from database. OR Use PreEntityImage.

Pre-Entity Image:
=================
=> To specify the required attributes needed for your Plugin logic.
=> You can get existing values of the form which are not changed during that update
